          <h3>2. JANAKI TEMPLE</h3>
          <p>According to myths and purans, Janakpur is the birthplace of  Goddess Sita. According to Ramayan, Janakpur was the realm of mighty King Janak who discovered the infant Sita under the ploughed farmland. The  golden statue of the Goddess Sita was found in 1657 AD. According to legend, it was Sannyasi Shurkishordas who found the images of Goddess Sita. He was the founder of modern Janakpur and poet who wrote about Sita Upasana.

          The current temple stands on the same exact place where the golden statue was found. The holy spot of the temple is believed to be the place where this Hindu deity once lived during her time on Earth. Vrisha Bhanu Devi, queen of the Indian state of Tikamgarhm ordered the construction of the temple in 1910 AD. The temple was constructed  at the cost of Rupees Nine Lakh( Nine Hundred Thousand). So the temple is also well renowned as ‘Naulakha Mandir’. Myths have also claimed that King Janak performed the worship of Shiva-Dhanus on this site.

          The temple is considered as the most important model of Rajput architecture in Nepal. It is the epitome of ancient craftsmanship. The temple rises 50m high above the ground and accommodates 60 rooms, which are all adorned with coloured glass, elegant and ancient paintings and engraved with spectacular engravings.The temple is coloured in bright white colour and covers an area of about 4860 square feet.

                  <h3>Lumbini</h3>
                  <p>The Lord Buddha was born in 623 BC in the sacred area of Lumbini located in the Terai plains of southern Nepal, testified by the inscription on the pillar erected by the Mauryan Emperor Asoka in 249 BC. Lumbini is one of the holiest places of one of the world's great religions, and its remains contain important evidence about the nature of Buddhist pilgrimage centres from as early as the 3rd century BC.

                    The complex of structures within the archaeological conservation area includes the Shakya Tank; the remains within the Maya Devi Temple consisting of brick structures in a cross-wall system dating from the 3rd century BC to the present century and the sandstone Ashoka pillar with its Pali inscription in Brahmi script. Additionally there are the excavated remains of Buddhist viharas (monasteries) of the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD and the remains of Buddhist stupas (memorial shrines) from the 3rd century BC to the 15th century AD. The site is now being developed as a Buddhist pilgrimage centre, where the archaeological remains associated with the birth of the Lord Buddha form a central feature.</p>

                    <li><strong>Route:</strong>By far the easiest way of getting from Kathmandu to Lumbini is to fly. The flight takes about 35 minutes, and there are several every day. Lumbini itself doesn't have an airport, but nearby Siddharthanagar does (this city was formerly called Bairahawa, and many people still call it that). Lumbini is less than an hour's drive north of the Gautam Buddha International Airport in Siddharthanagar, along the fairly straight Siddhartha Highway. Some accommodation options in Lumbini can arrange for a pick-up, or you can get a taxi from the airport. </li>

    <div class="visit">
        <p>Nepal still evades travellers’ bucket lists, and we for one can’t understand why: the views are stunning (you have jungle, lakes, and mountains), the people are friendly, it’s home to once-in-a-lifetime treks and it’s safe and affordable. So what are you waiting for? </p>

        <p align="center"><b>1. Learn the Culture of Kathmandu:</b><br>
            The capital of Nepal, Kathmandu is a cultural hub and somewhere you must visit to get the most out of the country. It’s a chaos of sounds, smells and action and will introduce you to a unique side of Nepal. Visit Durbar Square, dating back to the third century, where the city’s kings were crowned and legitimised, surrounded by courtyards and temples. In 2015, a devastating earthquake hugely affected Kathmandu, but the spirit of the city lives on and tourists continuing to travel here is vital to its survival. </p>

            People flock from all over the world to attempt the arduous (but doable) hike to Everest Base Camp (the South side, as the North Base Camp is in Tibet). At an altitude of 5,364 metres (nearly 18,000 feet) and some of the best mountain views in the world, the multiple-day trek is well worth the effort. Of course you’ll want to remember to take it slow and steady, with lots of training completed beforehand so that there are no surprises while you’re completing the 5 to 6 day hike to camp. Oh and remember to acclimatise, acclimatise and acclimatise!

        <p><b>3. Wildlife Reserves:</b><br>
            Not many people think of Nepal as a place abundant with wildlife, but oh, how wrong they’d be. Nepal has a large, diverse population of bird species, and if that’s not hardcore enough, head to Chitwan or Bardia National Park for a safari, tracking down crocodiles, rhinos, deers and the elusive Bengal Tiger. It’s also one of the few countries which is the habitat of clouded leopards (like leopards with bigger spots, but much more elusive), living high in the mountains, thought until recently to be extinct in Nepal.</p>

        <p><b>4. World Heritages:</b><br>
            You’d be hard pressed to find a place with quite as many UNESCO World Heritage Sites as Nepal – in Kathmandu Valley alone, there are seven sites (which count together as one World Heritage Listing, but that’s by the by), with additional ones in Chitwan National Park and Lumbini. So if you’ve got a plan to visit as many UNESCO World Heritage Sites as you can, a visit to Nepal will give you a big jump in the right direction.</p>

        <p><b>4. Affordable:</b><br>
            With hotel rooms for less than $20 (and guesthouses sometimes as little as $5), food for a day at $10 and budget experiences and activities, Nepal is a surprisingly affordable destination for travellers – it’s pretty easy to spend about or less than $30 a day. Of course, there are the more expensive options, like top hotels at around $150, but even with these, you’ll be getting one of the best rooms in the building. In the countryside, you shouldn’t be looking to spend more than $40 a night for a very comfortable stay. So if money is your Everest, this trip will be no problem for you.</p>

    <div class="religion">
        <p><b>6. Nepal-Religion:</b><br>
            Most of Nepal’s population practice Hinduism, but as already mentioned with the many stupas around, there is a heavy Buddhist influence, and also some Kiratism, Islam and Christianity, although in smaller populations. Because of this diversity of religion and multiculturalism, travelling around different parts of Nepal and learning about each region’s customs is an enlightening experience and shows what a unique place it is to visit.</p>

        <p><b>7. Nepali Cuisine:</b><br>
            With many different backgrounds and ethnicities, Nepal’s food is inevitably not to be missed. While the cuisine is influenced heavily by its neighbours, China and India, Nepal makes it their own and it’s generally more healthy than other countries in South East Asia. The dishes Dhal bat (lentil or chicken curry, boiled rice with vegetables, pickles and roti bread) and momo (Nepal’s version of dumplings) are must-tries.</p>
