            <h2 align="center">Why To Visit Nepal</h2>
            <div class="visit">
                <p>Nepal still evades travellers’ bucket lists, and we for one can’t understand why: the views are stunning (you have jungle, lakes, and mountains), the people are friendly, it’s home to once-in-a-lifetime treks and it’s safe and affordable. So what are you waiting for? </p>

                <p align="center"><b>1. Learn the Culture of Kathmandu:</b><br>
                    The capital of Nepal, Kathmandu is a cultural hub and somewhere you must visit to get the most out of the country. It’s a chaos of sounds, smells and action and will introduce you to a unique side of Nepal. Visit Durbar Square, dating back to the third century, where the city’s kings were crowned and legitimised, surrounded by courtyards and temples. In 2015, a devastating earthquake hugely affected Kathmandu, but the spirit of the city lives on and tourists continuing to travel here is vital to its survival. </p>

                <p><b>2. Mountains:</b><br>
                    People flock from all over the world to attempt the arduous (but doable) hike to Everest Base Camp (the South side, as the North Base Camp is in Tibet). At an altitude of 5,364 metres (nearly 18,000 feet) and some of the best mountain views in the world, the multiple-day trek is well worth the effort. Of course you’ll want to remember to take it slow and steady, with lots of training completed beforehand so that there are no surprises while you’re completing the 5 to 6 day hike to camp. Oh and remember to acclimatise, acclimatise and acclimatise!

                <p><b>3. Wildlife Reserves:</b><br>
                    Not many people think of Nepal as a place abundant with wildlife, but oh, how wrong they’d be. Nepal has a large, diverse population of bird species, and if that’s not hardcore enough, head to Chitwan or Bardia National Park for a safari, tracking down crocodiles, rhinos, deers and the elusive Bengal Tiger. It’s also one of the few countries which is the habitat of clouded leopards (like leopards with bigger spots, but much more elusive), living high in the mountains, thought until recently to be extinct in Nepal.</p>

                <p><b>4. World Heritages:</b><br>
                    You’d be hard pressed to find a place with quite as many UNESCO World Heritage Sites as Nepal – in Kathmandu Valley alone, there are seven sites (which count together as one World Heritage Listing, but that’s by the by), with additional ones in Chitwan National Park and Lumbini. So if you’ve got a plan to visit as many UNESCO World Heritage Sites as you can, a visit to Nepal will give you a big jump in the right direction.</p>

                <p><b>4. Affordable:</b><br>
                    With hotel rooms for less than $20 (and guesthouses sometimes as little as $5), food for a day at $10 and budget experiences and activities, Nepal is a surprisingly affordable destination for travellers – it’s pretty easy to spend about or less than $30 a day. Of course, there are the more expensive options, like top hotels at around $150, but even with these, you’ll be getting one of the best rooms in the building. In the countryside, you shouldn’t be looking to spend more than $40 a night for a very comfortable stay. So if money is your Everest, this trip will be no problem for you.</p>

                <p><b>6. Nepal-Religion:</b><br>
                    Most of Nepal’s population practice Hinduism, but as already mentioned with the many stupas around, there is a heavy Buddhist influence, and also some Kiratism, Islam and Christianity, although in smaller populations. Because of this diversity of religion and multiculturalism, travelling around different parts of Nepal and learning about each region’s customs is an enlightening experience and shows what a unique place it is to visit.</p>

                <p><b>7. Nepali Cuisine:</b><br>
                    With many different backgrounds and ethnicities, Nepal’s food is inevitably not to be missed. While the cuisine is influenced heavily by its neighbours, China and India, Nepal makes it their own and it’s generally more healthy than other countries in South East Asia. The dishes Dhal bat (lentil or chicken curry, boiled rice with vegetables, pickles and roti bread) and momo (Nepal’s version of dumplings) are must-tries.</p>
