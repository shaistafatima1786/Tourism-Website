            <h3>2. JANAKI TEMPLE</h3>
            <p>According to myths and purans, Janakpur is the birthplace of  Goddess Sita. According to Ramayan, Janakpur was the realm of mighty King Janak who discovered the infant Sita under the ploughed farmland. The  golden statue of the Goddess Sita was found in 1657 AD. According to legend, it was Sannyasi Shurkishordas who found the images of Goddess Sita. He was the founder of modern Janakpur and poet who wrote about Sita Upasana.

            The current temple stands on the same exact place where the golden statue was found. The holy spot of the temple is believed to be the place where this Hindu deity once lived during her time on Earth. Vrisha Bhanu Devi, queen of the Indian state of Tikamgarhm ordered the construction of the temple in 1910 AD. The temple was constructed  at the cost of Rupees Nine Lakh( Nine Hundred Thousand). So the temple is also well renowned as ‘Naulakha Mandir’. Myths have also claimed that King Janak performed the worship of Shiva-Dhanus on this site.

            The temple is considered as the most important model of Rajput architecture in Nepal. It is the epitome of ancient craftsmanship. The temple rises 50m high above the ground and accommodates 60 rooms, which are all adorned with coloured glass, elegant and ancient paintings and engraved with spectacular engravings.The temple is coloured in bright white colour and covers an area of about 4860 square feet. The entire structure of Janaki temple flaunts a classic blend of classical and Neo classical designs.</p>
